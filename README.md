Pilot an XWing to defeat as many TIE fighters as possible before losing all of your lives.

Each TIE fighter takes 6 hits to defeat, and its remaining hits are listed above each. You fire four shots each time.
If you fire too quickly, your laser will overheat and you will not be able to shoot for several seconds. 
Use the upper right to track overheat.
Additionally, you will have access to a torpedo after a loading time. The torpedo instantly kills any TIE in its
very large hitbox.

Controls:
Position is controlled by the mouse.  
S - Fire. Always shoots toward the center of the screen.  
A/D - Roll left or right (interchangeable). While rolling, you are briefly invincible.  
W - Fire torpedo.
